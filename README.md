This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: stack overflow. The `bug.hack` file contains a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. When called with a large number, the function will exceed the call stack limit, resulting in a stack overflow error. The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a solution using iteration to avoid the stack overflow error.
